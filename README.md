# Flashcards

When learning a new language, it can be hard to remember all the new vocabulary, which is exactly where flashcards can help. 
Typically, flashcards show a hint (a task or a picture) on one side and the right answer on the other. Flashcards can be
used to remember any sort of data, and they can be very useful for learning.
